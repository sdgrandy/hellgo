- An environmental variable must be a build arg in the docker-compose.yml file in order for it to be echoed in the Dockerfile. It must also be defined as an argument in the dockerfile.
- A variable included under "environment:" or "env_file" will be accessible to the container. It doesn't matter if it's build arg or included in the Dockerfile.
